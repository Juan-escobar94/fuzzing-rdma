Mellanox has been working on defining the rdma subsystem using syzlang \cite{lpc-2018},
which allows syzkaller to operate exclusively on this subsystem, in order to efficiently
fuzz the rdma api implementation inside the linux kernel. 

After testing syzkaller with the subset of system calls defined in the subsystem by ourselves, 
over a hundred crashes ocurred, of which 3 of them were unique (2 kernel panics, 1 KASAN null pointer
dereference report).
