\section{introduction}


Computer Systems have become indispensable in our everyday life. Examples vary 
from A to B. As they play important roles in our lives, we expect them to be 
stable


\subsection{goals}


The main goal of this work is to provide an instrument to fuzz kernel modules
in an enviroment in which kernel crashes are common. As a side goal, a better 
understanding of fuzzing techniques and their reliablity should also be attained.
