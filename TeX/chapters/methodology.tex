\section{Methodology}




the kernel was built using make 
defconfig and make kvmconfig % (TODO: research this config options to explain them)
kvmconfig sets values like config\_hypervisor\_guest=y



%TODO: make menu config, search for infiniband.
In order to retrieve the specific options to build infiniband support,  


build the kernel using -j\$(nproc) as a parameter for make inside the main source directory
inside the kernel source tree, after going after the proper configuration, using -j creates a 
thread for every subdirectory in the kernel tree, which can cause the machine to become 
unresponsive and take a much longer time to complete the build. \cite{kroah-hartman06}
