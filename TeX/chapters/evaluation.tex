\section{Evaluation}

In this section present the results achieved with different
fuzzing tools and explain under which settings we attained this results
in each subsection.

\subsection{Syzkaller}

We ran Syzkaller under two different kernel versions: 5.7.0 and 5.10.11, the latter was
the latest stable version available at the time we evaluated Syzkaller.

% We put a simple script that raises the necnecessary modules for SoftRoCE
We extracted the necessary system calls for specifically targetting the modules
in charge of RDMA in the Linux Kernel. For this, we wrote a simple python script
that reads the Syzlang definitions under ``syz/linux/dev\_infiniband\_rdma.txt'' inside the
Syzkaller source tree. The script uses regular expressions to identify the system call definitions
in the syntax of Syzlang and outputs the trimmed names of all system calls found in the file (without any arguments)
as comma separated values into antoher file. This was necessary, because we want to restrict Syzkaller
to fuzz RDMA modules in the Linux Kernel. We do this by providing all the system calls
extracted as comma separated values to the configuration parameter ``enable\_syscalls'' of Syzkaller.

% Talk a little bit more about the bugs maybe

For each of the Kernels, we let syzkaller run for a time window of approximately four hours.
For the \textbf{5.7.0} Kernel, Syzkaller found three distinct bugs,
triggered by different system call handlers inside RDMA modules. Syzkaller was able to generate
a C reproducer for two of the crashes.
For the \textbf{5.10.11} Kernel, Syzkaller found one crash and two warnings.


%% Extracted system calls for rdma subsystem,

%% restricted syzkaller to this subset of system calls

%% TWO kernels: 5.10

%% 5.7.0
%%
%% start: 17:28 (PC TIME)

\subsection{Proxy Fuzzer}

We ran the proxy fuzzer for a time window of approximately three hours.
We used different RDMA benchmark applications from the OFED Performance Tests repository\footnote{Found under: https://github.com/linux-rdma/perftest}.
After this time, the proxy fuzzer found two distinct bugs: one warning and a KASAN null pointer dereference error report.
