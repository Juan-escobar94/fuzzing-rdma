# Fuzzing Framework for RDMA API

## Introduction 

Computer Systems have become indispensable in our everyday life. Examples vary 
from A to B. As they play important roles in our lives, we expect them to be 
stable 


### Goals

The main goal of this work is to provide an instrument to fuzz kernel modules
in an enviroment in which kernel crashes are common. As a side goal, a better 
understanding of fuzzing techniques and their reliablity should also be attained.

## Background

### RDMA Technology

### Linux Kernel and Modules

Talk about the linux kernel being expandable by modules, which operate on
so called 'kernel space' or privileged mode, this makes them in turn mandatory
to be well tested, because  a malfunctioning module in this case a device 
driver a potential target inside the system.
